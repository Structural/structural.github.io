I don't need to convince you that getting your names right in your code is
important, because you know that already.
[You know](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html)
[it because](http://blog.shoutt.me/post/46725005593/why-you-should-never-ever-ever-have-managers-in-your)
[everyone is](http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2004/03/the_worlds_two_worst_variable.html)
[telling you](http://blog.smartbear.com/process/your-code-may-work-but-it-still-might-suck/)
[about it](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/how-to-name-a-variable-when-the-word-is-both-a-noun-and-a-verb/)
[all the time](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5215759).  The problem is that it obviously isn't
sticking, otherwise everyone wouldn't be shouting about it.  What we need is a
good catchphrase to wrap this whole conversation in.  Introducing...

<div class="hero">Semantic Debt</div>

Technical debt causes bugs, semantic debt causes confusion.  They both slow down
day-to-day development and complicate onboarding.  Just like technical debt
needs to be continually (or at least periodically) cleansed so that new
development can continue, we should both spend time up front to get our names
right and make time on a regular basis to fix names that no longer make sense.
Clearing out semantic debt is Febreze on the lexical couch cushions of our
application.

So the next time you spend half an hour coming up with just the right name for
a function, don't feel bad that you're wasting time, be proud - you just got
rid of some semantic debt.
