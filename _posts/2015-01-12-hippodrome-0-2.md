Hippodrome version 0.2 is out, and up on
[rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/hippodrome),
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hippodrome) and [bower](http://bower.io/).
0.2 is a breaking change to the API.
[Read this](https://github.com/Structural/hippodrome/blob/master/docs/hippodrome.md)
for a full description of the new API, or read on for a quick rundown of the
changes:

### Factory methods

All Hippodrome objects are now created with factory methods.  Use
`Hippodrome.createAction`, `Hippodrome.createStore` and
`Hippodrome.createDeferredTask` instead of `new Hippodrome.Action`,
`new Hippodrome.Store` and `new Hippodrome.DeferredTask`.

In addition, Actions now take an options hash instead of positional arguments:

```coffeescript
# New
myAction = Hippodrome.createAction
  displayName: 'My Action'
  build: (x) -> {value: x}

# Old
myAction = new Hippodrome.Action(
  'My Action',
  (x) -> {value: x}
)
```

### @dispatch method instead of dispatches list

For both Stores and Tasks, instead of registering for actions with a dispatches
list, use the `@dispatch` method inside `initialize`:

```coffeescript
# New
Hippodrome.createStore
  initialize: ->
    @dispatch(Actions.myAction).to(@update)
    @dispatch(Actions.otherAction)
      .after(Stores.OtherStore)
      .to(@otherUpdate)

  update: (payload) -> ...
  otherUpdate: (payload) -> ...

# Old
  dispatchs: [{
    action: Actions.myAction
    callback: 'update'
  }, {
    action: Actions.otherAction
    callback: 'otherUpdate'
    after: [Stores.OtherStore]
  }]

  update: (payload) -> ...
  otherUpdate: (payload) -> ...
```

Tasks that only need one action can still use `action` and `task` keys instead
of `@dispatch`.

### Hippodrome.start

Instead of running `initialize` when Stores are declared, it now gets run when
you call `Hippodrome.start`.  This lets you more easily have two stores that
wait on each other for different actions.  You can also pass an options hash to
`Hippodrome.start` and it'll be available as the first argument to `initialize`.

### Better listen mixins

Two new mixins to help Components listen to Stores with less boilerplate than
before.  `listen` takes a property name and a function and sets that state
property to the value of that function whenever the Store triggers.
`listenWith` takes the name of a component function that returns a state object
and calls that for `getInitialState` and `setState` whenever the Store triggers.

```coffeescript
React.createClass
  mixins: [
    Stores.MyStore.listen('text', Stores.MyStore.value)
    Stores.OtherStore.listenWith('otherStoreState')
  ]

  otherStoreState: ->
    return {
      value: Stores.OtherStore.get('data')
      thing: Stores.OtherStore.storeThing()
    }

  render: ->
    content = @state.text + ' ' + @state.value + ', ' + @state.thing
    return div({}, content)
```
