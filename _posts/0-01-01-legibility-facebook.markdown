From the Pew Internet study ["Teens, Social Media and Privacy"](http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Teens-Social-Media-And-Privacy/Summary-of-Findings.aspx):

> In focus groups, many teens expressed waning enthusiasm for Facebook.  They...

What's the difference (at least during the moment of early 2013) between
Facebook and Twitter/Instagram?  Why does "drama" seem to flare up on Facebook
regularly, and not on other networks?  In order to answer that, let me digress
for a moment in order to define "illegibility"  (no, it's not about your
<span class="note-link" data-note-id="rimshot">doctor's handwriting</span>).
I didn't invent the idea, but
it doesn't seem to have gained much traction in the circle of people who read
blog posts about Facebook, so here goes.  The degree to which something is
legible is the degree to which an outside observer can extract information or
meaning from it.  A classic example is of a state trying to levy taxes on its
population.  The state can easily keep track of citizens who live in a single
home for long periods of time, who have records of their employment and who keep
their money in financial institutions who abide by reporting requirements.
These citizens are legible to the state, and it's relatively easy to get them to
pay taxes on time and in full.  Other citizens are less legible: migrant workers
who don't have a fixed place of residence or employment, for example.  They're
no less citizens, but when the state looks at them through the lens of rules
designed for extracting tax from relatively stationary people, it's often very
unclear whether they should owe anything at all, and if so, to who.

Many more things are illegible than legible, and one of the lessons of
illegibility is that trying to turn the fundamentally illegible legible often
kills it.
<span class="note-link" data-note-id="venkat">The glue that holds groups of humans together is our shared illegible status</span>
- when we all think that we're all about as great as each other we can
band together, but any attempt to create a strict hierarchy will cleave us
apart. Stable, "drama"-free groups are mostly illegible.  Since the members
are all (as far as they can tell) on equal footing there's nothing for them to
fight over.

Facebook doesn't like illegibility, though.  Consider the 'relationship status'
dropdown.  Reducing the full scope of human relationships to a handful of options
is patently absurd, but there it is.  The drive towards legibility has a simple
motivation for Facebook: they need to sell ad space to keep
the lights on, and the reason people want to buy ads on Facebook is that the ads
can be targeted.  <span class="note-link" data-note-id="targeting">Targeting <em>requires</em> legibility.</span>  In order to target
advertising as effectively as possible, Facebook needs you, and your
relationships to everyone you know, to be as legible as possible.  This is why
<span class="note-link" data-note-id="creepy">Graph Search feels "creepy"</span> the first time you see it.  It's making things
that were illegible, and we instinctively feel should be illegible if we all
want to lead full inner and outer lives, legible.

So this is the central tension of Facebook: it needs to legible to make money,
but illegible so that the users don't revolt.  It may be the tension of all
social-oriented data-driven advertising.  How do you get users to form social
bonds in a panopticon?  <span class="note-link" data-note-id="illegible-ads">Illegible advertising</span> can certainly make money, but <span class="note-link" data-note-id="you-know-whats-cool">can
you use it to make several billion dollars on the internet?</span> If we're all
still using Facebook in ten years, will Pew come out with another study that
says we all still hate it?

And airplane food, what's up with that, am I right?

This idea is ripped pretty much wholesale from

Read the whole series.

<aside data-note-id="targeting"><p>
"Targeting" in this context is a metaphor, but like all good metaphors it
holds a grain of deep truth.  In order to target a gun or missile you need to be
able to literally see your target, and the same is metaphorically true for
advertising.

<aside data-note-id="creepy"><p>
Consider
<a href="http://actualfacebookgraphsearches.tumblr.com/)">Actual Facebook Graph Searches</a>.
"Creepy" as a feeling is easily dismissed (anything that occupies the same
rhetorical space as clowns often is), but it's important.  It's an instinctive
impression of something violating social norms that we should pay more attention
to and unpack when we encounter it.

<aside data-note-id="you-know-whats-cool"><p>
To show my biases, I don't think you can, not really.  I'd love to see a
future without a single apex predator in the social network space, but I'm not
sure what that looks like.  Specifically, I'm not sure where the money comes
from.  Charging users directly sounds nice, but means you sacrifice a lot of the
users you need, specifically teens, many of whom don't have disposable income.
</p></aside>

<aside data-note-id="illegible-ads"><p>
All advertising is to some extent targeted and legible, of course.  (There's
a line I've heard attributed to
<a href="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/">The Last Psychiatrist</a> - "If you're
seeing it, it's meant for you", but I can't find the source for it.)  But the
targeting and tracking increases we've seen in the last decade have made a
striking enough difference in the degree of legibility afforded advertisers that
we should consider it a different beast altogether.  Buying ad space
specifically on the National Geographic channel for your panda charity is
different than finding users who've searched in the past for "panda" and
"conservation".
