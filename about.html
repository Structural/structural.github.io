    <p>Structural is four guys in Boston, MA who like to write software</p>
    <i class="curly-flat-one"></i>
    <p>We think software should give its users the benefit of the doubt and be willing for them to try big things.  </p>

    <p> You should probably check out William Gibson's <a href="http://amzn.com/0425198685" target="_blank">Pattern Recognition</a>, and if it's up your ally, <a href="http://amzn.com/0399154302" target="_blank">Spook Country</a> and <a href="http://amzn.com/0425240770" target="_blank">Zero History</a> are pretty cool too. </p>
    <i class="curly-flat-three"></i>
    <p>We think the <a href="http://watertownlib.org" target="_blank">Watertown Free Public Library</a> is pretty rad.   </p>
