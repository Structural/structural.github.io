    <p>Oak's bough bends with snow
       Email drifts in my inbox
       Rabbit waits for spring</p>

    <p>Watertown's bound leaves
       Surround three developers for
       Nights and nights and days</p>

    <p>Acorn in Brookline
       Gets planted in Arlington
       Shows roots in Cambridge</p>

    <p>The T drips downhill
       With the thaw; a curious
       Tree shows its first leaf</p>
