<h1><a href='http://watercoolr.io' target='_blank'>Water Cooler</a></h1>

<p>Communicating at work is tough.  That's why you get payed the big bucks.   Open ended creative discussions can be especially tough.   Sometimes a discussion around the water cooler is a lot more effective than creating tickets, scheduling phone calls or writing emails.  </p>

<p> Water Cooler is desinged to make text based communications as smooth as a genuine and informal
conversations in the hallway.  </p>

<p> Email is stressful.  You get tonnes of it.  You send a tonne of it.

<p> We think that one of the main reseasons that email is so stressful has to do with having to "do it right" with every single message you send.
