title: Who are these Structural people
link_text: About
---

Structural is four guys from Boston.  We build software, like
[Water Cooler](http://watercooler.io), whose beta you should totally sign up
for.  You should also [follow us on Twitter](http://twitter.com/structuralists).  In the past, we've made several uproarious twitter jokes such as

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>hyphen-case&#10;-kebab-case-&#10;|â€”rotisserie-caseâ€”|&#10;Â¯\_(s h r u g c a s e)_/Â¯&#10;ðŸ‘»ScoobyðŸ˜±DooðŸ”ŽCaseðŸš“</p>&mdash; Structural (@structuralists) <a href="https://twitter.com/structuralists/status/473150223750266881">June 1, 2014</a></blockquote>

If you want more dumb stuff like that, we got you covered.  Twitter not for you?
You're probably literally a dinosaur, like, a pterodactyl.  (Hey,
congrats on the whole flying thing.)  That's cool though - hit us up on
email: [structural@structur.al](mailto:structural@structur.al)

We also [publish some code on Github](https://github.com/Structural).

## But who are you individually?

You should really just skip this section.  We're all pretty much the worst, I
promise you don't want to invite us over for dinner or anything.  If you really
want to pull back that curtain, though...

* William Lubelski ([@uiwill](http://twitter.com/uiwill))
* Nick Martin ([@n_w_martin](http://twitter.com/n_w_martin))
* Sean Kermes is not on Twitter because he is a dinosaur (Stegosaurus)
* Ben Jones ([@bcjonesey](http://twitter.com/bcjonesey))

## Do you have any random links to stuff you think I should see?

Why yes, yes we do!  Thanks so much for asking.
